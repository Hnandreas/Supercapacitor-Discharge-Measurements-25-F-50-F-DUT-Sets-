# Example images

This folder stores example images illustrating the measurement setups, sample waveforms, and summary plots. Only include preview images (PNG/JPG/SVG) suitable for public display; do not put original high-resolution raw images or images that reveal sensitive details.

Suggested example filenames:
- setup_overview.png
- measurement_rig_photo.jpg
- sample_waveforms.png
- comparative_plot_25F_vs_50F.svg

Guidelines
- Use reduced resolution and file size for preview images (sufficient for review/visual inspection).
- Do not include any images that allow reconstruction of sensitive raw data or participant-identifying information.
- Caption images clearly in accompanying README/Release Notes.
