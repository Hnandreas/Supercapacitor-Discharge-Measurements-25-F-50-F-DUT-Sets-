# Measurement Data – 50 F Supercapacitors

This folder contains measurement data, results and related files for supercapacitor discharge tests using 50 F units (Vishay manufacturer). Only preview/example files that are safe to share publicly should be placed here. Do not upload full raw datasets or sensitive files.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset (Validation Set) includes eight 50 F, 3.0 V EDLCs from Vishay, all from the same production batch to ensure uniformity and to quantify consistency and variation within a single batch.

The tests were conducted according to IEC 62391-1 using three discharge currents:
- Method 1A Class current (Class 2, 0.06 A)
- ESR current (ESR Class 2 / C Class 3, 0.60 A)  
- Method 1B high-current discharge (3.41 A, corresponding to 95% efficiency criterion)

Each DUT was tested under all three conditions, resulting in 24 discharge curves total. For detailed information about the experimental setup and measurement procedures, see the [Main Repository README](../README.md#experimental-setup-and-methodology).
